        <h1 class="container-title uppercase">About me </h1>
        <p class="container-body">I started learning to program in the 7th grade with ActionScript 2.0, which led me to focus my high school studies on Computer Science and programming. All I've wanted to do with my life since is program.</p>
        <p class="container-body">I'm currently headed into my 3rd year at the University of Ottawa. I am pursuing an <strong>Honours B.Sc. with a Specialization in Computer Science</strong> and am currently earning a <strong>9.6 GPA</strong> (out of 10) across all my Computer Science courses (9.3 overall).</p>
        <p class="container-body">In addition to programming, I also love to write when I can find the time, and try to stay in shape by running in the summer and nordic skiing in the winter.</p>
