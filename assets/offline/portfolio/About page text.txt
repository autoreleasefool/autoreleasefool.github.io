        <p>In my free time when I'm not trying to learn everything I can about being a developer, I can be found doing a number of different activities.<br />
        Creative Writing: I'm a member of the Creative Writing Club at the University of Ottawa and I enjoy writing young adult fiction, fantasy and poetry. Every November I sign up for NaNoWriMo and dedicate a month to trying to write a new story.<br />
        Game Jams: Every 4 months I participate in Ludum Dare, a 48 hour game creating competition. Check out my portfolio for the best entries I've submitted so far.<br />
        Cross Country Running/Skiing: Through Spring, Summer and Autumn I like to stay in shape by running and training for 10k races and half-marathons. In the Winter, I Nordic Ski in my free time.</p>
