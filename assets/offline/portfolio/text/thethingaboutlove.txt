The Thing About Love

Here’s the thing about love:
I’m tired of it.

Over the past few years it’s only
dragged me down.
Kept me from taking chances.
As great as love is
it’s not for me.

Here’s the thing about love:
I’m done with it.
 Done with the late nights worrying about it
my days of stressing over love
have come to an end.
I need a break
from love.

Here’s the thing about love.
It’s ruining my life.

I thought that love was the only thing that I knew.
The only thing in my life that I could be sure of.
But now I know that love
simply doesn’t have a place in my future.

And here’s the thing about love.
It’s not the problem.
And here’s the thing about this poem.
It’s you, not love.
